* One Time Install *
install latest node
install latest npm (comes for free with node)
npm install -g create-react-app
# All set!

* Create a project
create-react-app (path-to-folder) [from command line.  This creates your entire development pipeline. build, lint, etc.  Basically, all the bullshit boilerplate dependencies for "hello world"]
#Docs: https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md

* Running the server
npm start (in that directory)

* development
index.js is responsible for rendering your App.js

#import App from './App'; This runs "App.js".
 - If you leave out an extension, it will assume .js.

 * How to run a test
 npm test (inside directory)
  - Spits out results
  - You can provide a specific file. If you don't, it will run all files that end with test.js by convention
  - Looks inside "src" by default
  - There is a plugin with vs code that can auto run all tests as soon as you save
 - Look into how to create good tests and see what are good patterns

 * Rendering
  - this.state => lives on "Component" which is your data.  When you call "setState", it sets this property and then automatically calls "render" for you and only renders exactly what is needed.

 * Debugging
  - install a chrome extension for debugging react apps. "React Dev Tools"
